My First client side website made using html,css,javascript and some jquery

To open the website :

    1.Download all the files and store it in a folder on your computer.

    2.Open homepage.html in notepad and change all the image folder references to the new directory names (folder in which you downloaded the files into).

    3.Open homepage.html using a internet browser(preferably google chrome).
